Architecture on Firebolt using CoinjoinXT

## CoinJoinXT implementation

CoinJoinXT is non-custodial privacy technique which is closely related to CoinJoin. It allows for any number of entities to between them create a so-called proposed transaction graph (PTG) which is a list of connected transactions. In the PTG the bitcoins belonging to the entities are sent to and fro in all the transactions, but at the end of the PTG they are all returned to their rightful owners. The system is set up so that the process of the PTG being mined is atomic, so either the entire PTG is confirmed on the blockchain or none of it is, this means none of the participating entities can steal from each other. 

**Current Status - PUBLIC ALPHA**

## What makes CoinjoinXT different


**Fast**

Use small blocks per circles powered by Taproot and Segwit


**Usable**

Simple UI/UX


**Strong**

Structurally built on a  proposed transaction graph (PTG).

 - Atomic
 - DOS-resistant
 - Compatible with Coinswap
 - Use less block space thanks to the Taproot
 - More privacy between L1 and L2 using Lightning Network

## Architecture

TBD
